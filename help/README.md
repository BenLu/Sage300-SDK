## Classic Help Files

For Sage 300 2020, a change was made to the Classic (Desktop) SDK to no longer 
deliver CHM files in the installation. But, these help files are still required
by the user (developer) for providing relevant help information on SDK and
related topics.

The help links were modified to point to **classic** folder where the file or files 
can be downloaded to access the desired help.
