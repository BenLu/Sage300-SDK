# Classic Help Files

As with any file downloaded from the internet, there is a possibility that the downloaded
or cloned CHM and ZIP files may be blocked as the file system could detect that the files
came from another computer and is protecting your computer.

If the CHM or ZIP file is blocked, simply access the properties of the file and select
the "Unblock" checkbox.
