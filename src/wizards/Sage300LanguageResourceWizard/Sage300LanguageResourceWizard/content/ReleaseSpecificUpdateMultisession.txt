As part of the framework changes required to handle multiple sessions in
Sage 300c 2020.0, several files need to be altered for the solution to
compile and run after the upgrade process.

The upgrade wizard is unable to automatically perform this
modification and therefore this step will require manual modifications.

The following files are affected (all within the Namespace.Web project):
	- XXAreaRegistration.cs
	- Global.asax.cs
	- PageUrl.txt
	- Web.config
	- All JavaScript behaviour files

Please refer to the 'Multiple Sessions changes' subsection in the 
Sage 300 Upgrade Guide for 2019.2 to 2020.0 in the docs folder of the Web 
SDK for detailed instructions. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
