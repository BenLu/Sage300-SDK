Global files (CSS, CSHTML, JavaScript, etc.) are maintained by Sage.

If these files are modified or enhanced during the release cycle, they
will require synchronization.

The following files will be evaluated:

     * Existing common files will be updated, if needed
     * New common files will be added, if any
     * Third party libraries will be upgraded, if needed
     * Web content files will be synchronized
