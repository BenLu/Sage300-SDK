The 'XML documentation file' property determines whether an XML
file will be generated during compilation. When this option is enabled,
XML documentation is automatically emitted into an XML file, which will 
have the same name as the project, but with an .xml extension.

When enabling this property, all public classes, methods, 
properties, constants, and enums must have proper XML documentation 
comments, otherwise there will be warnings and/or errors when 
compiling the projects and solution.

This property can be enabled when upgrading by selecting the checkbox
below. It may also be manually enabled at any point by accessing the project's
Properties\Build options.
