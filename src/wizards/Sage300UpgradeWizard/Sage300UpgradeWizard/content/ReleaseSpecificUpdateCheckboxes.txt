In addition, as part of the framework changes in Sage 300c 2020.2, checkboxes
and radio buttons also had a visual upgrade.

The updated elements will inherit the new visual upgrade correctly if they are
created using the Sage 300 HtmlHelperExtension. For customized elements that 
are not using the HtmlHelperExtension, you may make use of the utility so that
the elements will have the same visual style and benefit from the visual
upgrade.

Please refer to the 'Checkboxes and Radio Buttons changes' subsection in the
Sage 300 Upgrade Guide for 2020.1 to 2020.2 in the docs folder of the Web SDK
for detailed instructions. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
