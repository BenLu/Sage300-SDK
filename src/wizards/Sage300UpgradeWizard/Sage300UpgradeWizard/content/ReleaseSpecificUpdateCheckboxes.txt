In additional, as part of the framework changes in Sage 300c 2020.2, checkboxes
and radio buttons also had a visual upgrade.

The updated elements will display correctly if they are created using the Sage
300 HtmlHelperExtension. For customized elements that are not using the
HtmlHelperExtension, please make use of the utility so that the elements will
have the same visual style.

Please refer to the 'Checkboxes and Radio Buttons changes' subsection in the
Sage 300 Upgrade Guide for 2020.1 to 2020.2 in the docs folder of the Web SDK
for detailed instructions. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
