The way the Code Generation Wizard builds and stores enumerations has changed 
from release {0} to {1}.

Instead of creating a different, unique enumeration file for each unique enumeration,
the code generation wizard will now consolidate enumerations into a single file on
a per-directory basis in the Models project. This file is called 'Enumerations.cs'
