The Context object that is passed into the Authentication Manager needs an
extra parameter in Sage 300 2018.1.

A small modification will need to be made to the ASP.NET application file 
Global.asax.cs (found within the Namespace.Web project) for the project to
run after the upgrade process.

The upgrade wizard is unable to automatically perform this
modification and therefore this step will require manual modifications.

Please refer to the 'Modify Context object parameter' subsection in the 
Sage 300 Upgrade Guide for 2018 to 2018.1 in the docs folder of the Web SDK 
for detailed instructions. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
