The Authentication Manager's LoginResult function has been updated in 
Sage 300 2018 with an additional parameter. 

A small modification will need to be made to the ASP.NET application file 
global.asax.cs (found within the Namespace.Web project) for the project to
compile after the upgrade process.

The upgrade wizard is unable to automatically perform this
modification and therefore this step will require manual modifications.

Please refer to the 'Modify LoginResult Function' subsection in the Sage 300 
Upgrade Guide for 2017.2 to 2018 in the docs folder of the Web SDK for 
detailed instructions. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
