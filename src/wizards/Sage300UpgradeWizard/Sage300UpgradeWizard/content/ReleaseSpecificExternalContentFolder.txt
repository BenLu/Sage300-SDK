The way menu images (background and icon) are managed and structured 
has changed in this release.

A new folder called 'ExternalContent' will be added to the 
'\Areas\{0}\' folder. The menu background and icon images 
will be moved to this new folder and renamed as follows:

menuBackGroundImage.jpg => bg_menu_{0}.jpg
menuIcon.png => icon_{0}.png

Please Note: XX is just a placeholder for the actual Module Id 
that will be used.
