For the 2022.0 release of Sage 300, the javascript minification process 
no longer uses a tool/application called Web Grease. It has been replaced 
by a new application called Terser. Terser is a NodeJS-based component and 
requires the download and installation of NodeJS.

Please refer to the "Javascript Minification Updates" subsection in the Sage 300
Upgrade Guide for 2021.2 to 2022.0 in the docs folder of the Web SDK for
detailed instructions. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
