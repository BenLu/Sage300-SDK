As part of the framework changes in Sage 300c 2020.2, the Newtonsoft.Json
package needs to be updated from 6.0.8 version to 9.0.1 version or above. If
your project is using a newer version than 9.0.1, you can ignore this step and
continue.

The upgrade wizard is unable to automatically perform this modification and
therefore this step will require manual modifications.

Please refer to the 'Upgrade Newtonsoft.Json Package' subsection in the Sage
300 Upgrade Guide for 2020.1 to 2020.2 in the docs folder of the Web SDK for
more information.
